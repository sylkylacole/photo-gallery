# 2024 Gallery Website

## Background

This was created with the original intention of learning Vite and React, but turned into a full fledged project!

Currently, the base design is completely done! The front end is great, but could use some media queries for responsive design (especially for mobile devices).

Eventually, I wish to add a backend and make this its own, self-sufficient project! As with a lot of my projects, they will be expanded upon as I learn more ^^ ESPECIALLY on the backend (being that there is no backend LOL)

## Next steps
- Add media queries to make the website responsive; change some measurements
- Add a backend that allows photo/video replacement through uploading an image in files
- Expand upon the backend to preserve the images and videos they uploaded
- Allow users to change the colors of the website; add other settings as well (accessible through the settings icon)
